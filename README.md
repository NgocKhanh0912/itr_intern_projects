# ITR Intern projects
## These are the projects that my team and I worked on during our Embedded Firmware internship at ITR VN.
## These projects include both documentation and firmware:
### Documentation (including sequence diagrams, flowcharts, and FSM): 
#### Documentation was written and designed using PlantUML and draw.io.
### Firmware: 
#### Using the STM32F411 Discovery board
#### The firmware is structured according to a layered architecture, divided into layers such as BSP, Driver, Middleware, and System, to assign specific tasks to each layer and facilitate project management. 
#### The firmware is developed to implement the designs from the documentation step.
